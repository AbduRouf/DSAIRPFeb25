# Demystifying Terms Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence
## Artificial Intelligence
AI is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI is classified into narrow AI (ANI), which is designed for specific tasks, and general AI (AGI), which aims for human-like cognition.


## Artificial General Intelligence
AGI refers to machines that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across various tasks, similar to human intelligence. Unlike narrow AI, AGI would be capable of self-improvement, reasoning, and adapting to new environments without explicit programming.

## History of Artificial Intelligence
Perceptron (1958)
The perceptron, developed by Frank Rosenblatt, was one of the earliest artificial neural networks. It was designed as a simplified model of how neurons in the brain process information. However, it had limitations, particularly in solving non-linearly separable problems (e.g., XOR problem).

##Backpropagation (1986)
Backpropagation is an algorithm used to train deep neural networks by adjusting weights through gradient descent. Introduced by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams, it significantly improved AI's learning capability, leading to advances in neural networks.

##AI Winter
AI Winter refers to periods of reduced funding and interest in AI research due to unmet expectations. Notable AI winters occurred in the 1970s and 1980s when AI progress slowed down, and investors lost confidence in its potential.

##DARPA Grand Challenge (2005)
This was a competition organized by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop autonomous vehicles. The challenge marked a breakthrough in self-driving car technology, with Stanley, an autonomous vehicle by Stanford University, winning the 2005 race.

##ImageNet 2012
The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2012 marked a major leap in deep learning when AlexNet, developed by Geoffrey Hinton’s team, significantly outperformed traditional computer vision models. This event led to the deep learning revolution.

##2024 Nobel Prize in Physics
(Pending real-world event confirmation) If awarded for AI-related advancements, it would highlight AI’s impact on scientific discovery, computational models, or quantum AI.

##Deepseek
Deepseek is a recent AI model or initiative (details depend on context). It may refer to DeepSeek-V2, an advanced AI model aimed at improving natural language processing (NLP) and reasoning capabilities.

## Key Deciding Factors of Growth of AI
Computational Power – Availability of high-performance GPUs and TPUs.
Data Availability – Large-scale datasets for training AI models.
Algorithmic Advancements – Innovations in deep learning, transformers, and reinforcement learning.
Funding & Investment – Government and private sector funding.
Ethical & Regulatory Frameworks – Balancing AI development with responsible usage.

## Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
Data Science involves collecting, analyzing, and interpreting large datasets.
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broader concept of machines mimicking cognitive functions.

## Data Science Application Domains
Healthcare – Disease prediction, drug discovery, medical imaging.
Finance – Fraud detection, algorithmic trading.
Retail – Customer recommendations, demand forecasting.
Manufacturing – Predictive maintenance, automation.
Transportation – Self-driving cars, traffic management.

## Correlation Vs. Causation
Correlation – A statistical relationship between two variables (e.g., ice cream sales and shark attacks).
Causation – A direct cause-and-effect relationship (e.g., smoking causes lung cancer).
AI models often find correlations but struggle with true causal inference.

## Ethics in AI
Bias & Fairness – Ensuring AI does not reinforce discrimination.
Privacy – Protecting user data and avoiding surveillance misuse.
Transparency – Making AI decision-making explainable.
Accountability – Assigning responsibility for AI-driven decisions.
AI for Good – Ensuring AI contributes positively to society.
